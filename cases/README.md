This directory contains the svg files that I submitted for the
cases that I had fabbed at ponoko.

I generally use 4.5mm clear acrylic. The thickness is important
as several of the cases have tabs that fit into slots.

Note that I may have included fewer or more pieces than necessary
to maximize panel space on the ponoko order. For example, the 
nixie tube clock order was short a top panel (top panel is the
same as the bottom panel), while the cp/m case included lots of
extra pieces.
